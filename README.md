In this repository you will find my ongoing Portfolio projects that I'm creating to become a better coder!

## Tic Tac Toe

This command line game coded in python is an interactive game for 2 players. It can take player names, randomly draws who gets to start (this is an advantage in TicTacToe!), and determines once a winner is found.

Because not everyone has a Magnus Carlsen like memory, it also gives you the updated game board after every move!


```
Thank you for playing Tic Tac Toe! 

What is the name of player 1? Anna

What is the name of player 2? Max

Max starts!

This is what your board looks like! 

 1 | 2 | 3
 ---------
 4 | 5 | 6
 ---------
 7 | 8 | 9

To reference a specific field, just type in the number!

Max it's your turn. Where do you want to place your move?

```

## Google Calendar Customization Automization

This is a true #nerdybynature project. At some point I got fed up with always having to manually change the colour of my calendar events, so I wrote and employed this small Google Apps Script that automaticall detects keywords in the event title and changes the colour. This feature is much more helpful than one would think!
